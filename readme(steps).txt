1. Data Loading and Initial Inspection:

Load the CSV: We'll load synthetic_sales_data.csv into a Pandas DataFrame.

Inspect the Data: Check the data types, look for any obvious errors or inconsistencies, 
and get a feel for the data's structure. We'll use functions like .head(), .info(), and .describe().

2. Data Preprocessing:

Filtering by Product Category: Choose one product_category to focus on initially. 
(You can repeat the analysis for other categories later.)

Handling Missing Values: Impute the missing values in competitor_price_index.
 We'll use a simple method like mean/median imputation for now.

Outlier Clipping/Winsorization: Cap the extreme values in daily_sales to mitigate their influence on the distribution fitting. 
winsorizing to the 99th and 1st percentile is a good choice here.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive Statistics: Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, etc.) 
for the daily_sales within the chosen category.

Histograms: Visualize the distribution of daily_sales using histograms. 
This will give us a visual sense of the shape of the distribution and help us choose candidate probability distributions.

4. Probability Distribution Fitting:

Candidate Distributions: Based on the EDA, select a few candidate probability 
distributions that might be a good fit for the data (e.g., Normal, Poisson, Negative Binomial, Gamma).

Parameter Estimation: Estimate the parameters of each candidate distribution
 using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or other appropriate methods.

Goodness-of-Fit Tests: Use statistical tests (e.g., Chi-squared test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)
 to quantitatively compare how well each candidate distribution fits the observed data. Select the best-fitting distribution based on the test results and visual inspection.

5. Demand Forecasting (Basic Example):

Future Date Range: Create a date range for future sales prediction.

Generate Predictions: Simulate a series of random values of sales by
 category using your chosen distribution. This will give you the probability of selling at different sale levels.

Visualization: Create a histogram of the predicted sales.

Probability Calculation: Calculate the probability of reaching certain sales targets
 (e.g., probability of selling more than X units) using the fitted distribution's cumulative distribution function (CDF).
